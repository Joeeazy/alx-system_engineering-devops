# Issue Summary:

Duration: June 9, 2024, 10:00 M â€” June 10, 2024, 2:00 PM (UTC)

Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in slow response times and partial service disruption. Approximately 20% of users were affected during this period.

Root Cause: An overloaded cache layer caused increased latency and intermittent failures.

# Timeline:

June 9, 2024, 12:15 PM (UTC): The issue was detected through monitoring alerts showing a significant increase in response time.

Actions taken: Initially suspected a database problem, focusing on recent schema changes during deployment.

Misleading investigation: Attention was directed towards the database cluster.

Escalation: The incident was escalated to the database administration team for assessment.

June 10, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC): The root cause was identified as an overloaded cache layer.

Resolution: The infrastructure team adjusted the cache configuration and implemented a monitoring system.

# Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause was an overloaded cache layer, evicting frequently accessed data due to increased system load.

The issue was resolved by adjusting the cache configuration and implementing proactive monitoring.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

# Improvements:

Optimize cache eviction policies.

Evaluate and scale cache infrastructure.

Enhance monitoring and alert mechanisms.

Conduct regular load testing and capacity planning.

Refine incident response procedures.

# Tasks:

Patch cache eviction policies to prioritize frequently accessed data.

Assess scalability of cache infrastructure and explore distributed caching solutions.

Deploy comprehensive monitoring covering cache utilization, response times, and database performance.

Perform regular load testing to validate system performance.

Review and update incident response procedures for swift resolution.
