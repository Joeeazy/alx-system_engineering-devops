# OSI Model

* What it is
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. 

Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with adjacent layers, providing a modular approach to understanding and designing network architectures. 

The model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to promote interoperability and compatibility between different systems and vendors.
