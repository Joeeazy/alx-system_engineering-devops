# OSI Model

* What it is
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. 

Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with adjacent layers, providing a modular approach to understanding and designing network architectures. 

The model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to promote interoperability and compatibility between different systems and vendors.

* How many layers it has
The OSI Model consists of the following seven layers, listed from the lowest level to the highest level:

* Physical Layer: Deals with the physical connection between devices, defining characteristics such as voltage levels, data rates, and physical connectors.

* Data Link Layer: Responsible for creating a reliable link between two directly connected nodes, addressing errors in the physical layer and ensuring the accurate delivery of frames.

* Network Layer: Manages the routing of data packets between devices on different networks, handling logical addressing and providing routing, forwarding, and congestion control.

* Transport Layer: Ensures the reliable delivery of data between devices, handling end-to-end communication, error detection, and flow control. This layer is responsible for breaking down large messages into s  maller segments and reassembling them on the receiving end.

* Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications, managing dialogue control, synchronization, and data exchange.

* Presentation Layer: Translates data between the application layer and the lower layers, handling data format translation, encryption, compression, and other presentation-related tasks.

* Application Layer: Provides network services directly to end-users or applications, dealing with high-level protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, and FTP. This layer is the closest to the end-user and interacts dire  ctly with software applications.
